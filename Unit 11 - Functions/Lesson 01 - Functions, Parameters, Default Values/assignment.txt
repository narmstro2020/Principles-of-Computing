Create a function that asks for a user's first and last name.
Stores it in a local variable called name
print out name converted to lower case

Then call the function a few times.  

Call the function print_lower
It shouldn't take any parameters

Here is a idea of the start

def print_lower():
    #get name from input function 
    #print name.lower()

#call the function
#call the function again.
