Create a function that prints asks for a user's first and last name 
and stores it in a local variable called name
print out name converted to lower case

Then call the function a few times.  

Call the function print_lower
It should take any parameters

Here is a idea of the start

def print_lower():
    #put your function logic Here

#call the function
#call the function again.
