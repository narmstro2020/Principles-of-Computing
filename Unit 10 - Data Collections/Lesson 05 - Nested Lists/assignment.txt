Create a 2d table of your list of five movies
Each row should contain a list that stores the number rank of your movie, then the name so something like this
fav_movies = [
    [1, "Star Wars"],
    [2, "Godfather"], 
    etc..
]

Then print the table row by row like in the examples before
use one for loop.  

for row in fav_movies:
    print(row)
