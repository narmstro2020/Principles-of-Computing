Create a dictionary of rankings for the key as numbers and movie titles as values.  
Using your top 10 movies

Something like this

movies = {
    1 : "The Godfather",
    2 : "Raiders of the Lost Ark",

    etcetera etceters and so on.  
}

for ranking, movie in movies.items():
    print("Movie #", ranking, "is", movie)

for item in movies.item():
    (ranking, movie) = item
    print("Movie #", ranking, "is", movie)

for item in movies.items():
    print("Movie #", item[0], "is", item[1])




Then use a for loop to print each movie like so

"Movie #1 is The Godfather"
"Movie #2 is ...
and so on
