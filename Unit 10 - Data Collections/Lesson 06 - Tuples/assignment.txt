get x from user input
get y from user input
convert x and y to ints and store in x and y
make a tuple called ordered_pair_2d using x and y
get z from user input
turn z into an int and store in z
make a tuple called z_tuple using (z, )
make a tuple called ordered_pair_3d as ordered_pair_2d + z_tuple
