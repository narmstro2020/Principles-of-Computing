Take your favorite movies list and append the next 5 favorites to it. Use the append method 5 times. 

Then replace your 2nd favorite movie with something else using the insert method.   
This will actually give you 11 movies at the end.  But that's okay.  

fav_movies.append("Star Wars")
fav_movies.append("Back to the Future")
