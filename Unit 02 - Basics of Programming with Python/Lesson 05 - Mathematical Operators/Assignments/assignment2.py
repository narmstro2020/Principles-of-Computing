'''
Write a program that asks the user how many miles they ran and how many minutes it took to run that far. 

Since we know nothing of user input at this point just use random numbers for the miles and minutes

Convert their speed to miles per hour and print out their speed.

Sample Output:  

How many miles did you run? 3
How many minutes did it take you? 60
Speed in mph: 3.0
