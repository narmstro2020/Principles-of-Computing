'''
Create a temperature converter.  

Ask the user for the temperature in Fahrenheit as a variable F
Convert this to a float
Use the following math to figure out the degrees in Celsius
C = 5 * (F - 32) / 9
C is the Celsius temperature.  
print out the result.  

Then do the the same for Celsius.  
Ask the user for the temp in Celsius and convert to Fahrenheit
The Formula is
F = 1.8 * C + 32
'''
F_text = input("Enter the temp in degrees F: ")
F = float(F_text)
C = 5 * (F - 32) / 9
print("The temp in degrees C is", C)

C_text = input("Enter the temp in degrees C: ")
#YOUDO the rest.  Find the temperature in degrees F
